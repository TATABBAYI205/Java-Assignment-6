Difference b/w Collection and collection in Java:-
=================================================
In the context of Java, "Collection" (with an uppercase 'C') refers to an interface defined in the Java Collections Framework. It is the root interface that represents a group of objects and defines the basic operations that can be performed on a collection, such as adding, removing, and iterating over elements. The `Collection` interface is part of the `java.util` package.

On the other hand, "collections" (with a lowercase 'c') is a term used more generally to refer to any group of objects or a specific implementation class in the Java Collections Framework. It can refer to any class that implements one of the collection interfaces, such as `List`, `Set`, or `Map`. For example, `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap` are all different implementations of collections.

To summarize:

- "Collection" (with an uppercase 'C'): Refers to the `Collection` interface in the Java Collections Framework.

- "collections" (with a lowercase 'c'): Refers to groups of objects or specific implementation classes that implement the collection interfaces defined in the Java Collections Framework.
